# 🌳 Tree Species Classification App

A smart, AI-powered web application that identifies **plant and tree species** from images of leaves, stems, or flowers. Whether you're a student, nature enthusiast, or botanist, this tool offers an engaging way to explore the plant world using the power of artificial intelligence.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Instant Species Detection**  
Upload an image of a plant or leaf and get quick, accurate predictions of its species — including common and scientific names.

✅ **Multiple Image Support**  
Improve accuracy by uploading more than one image (e.g., leaf + fruit).

✅ **User-Friendly Web Interface**  
No coding required! Just drag and drop your images in a clean, intuitive UI built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

✅ **Confidence Scores**  
Each prediction comes with a percentage score to show how confident the model is.

## 🌱 How It Works

1. 📤 **Upload** one or two images of a plant, tree, or leaf.
2. 🧠 The app processes the image using intelligent classification models.
3. 🌿 You receive a list of **likely species** with names and confidence levels.
